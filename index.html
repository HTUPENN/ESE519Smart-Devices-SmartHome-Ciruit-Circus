        <h2>Discription</h2>
        <p>This project was a significant learning experience in IoT system design, integrating hardware and software to create an intelligent, automated home. This IoT-based smart home system capable of automating multiple home appliances and transmitting real-time data to a smartphone app for bidirectional control. The system integrates a variety of sensors, motors, and communication protocols, enabling responsive and customizable functionality. The core control logic was programmed into an ATmega328PB Xplained Board, which communicates with an ESP32 microcontroller via SPI, and data is further transmitted to the Blynk cloud through MQTT.</p>

        <p>The below figures illlustrated the segment and whole system circuitry, where we used ATmega328PB as the manipulator programmed in bare metal C, and ESP32-FeatherS2 as the communication station to receive manipulator's feedback via SPI and publish to the IoT cloud(Blynk cloud) and deliver remote control demand from the user(typical Blynk app) back to the manipulator.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>SRS Validation</h2>
        <h3>Did you achieve your requirements?</h3>
        <p>Yes, we successfully met all the requirements outlined in the SRS.</p>
        <h3>How did you test?</h3>
        <p>We performed extensive testing using the following methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Functional testing: Verified all system functionalities against requirements.</li>
            <li>Proof of work: See below for videos and images.</li>

    <section>
        <h2>HRS Validation</h2>
        <h3>Did you achieve your requirements?</h3>
        <p>Yes, we achieved all hardware-related specifications as per the HRS document.</p>
        <h3>How did you test?</h3>
        <p>Hardware tests were conducted as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stress testing under various load conditions.</li>
            <li>Hardware integration tests with proof of work.</li>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <h3>What would you have done differently?</h3>
        <p>If we had more time, we would have focused on optimizing the system for better performance and added additional features, such as real-time data monitoring and an enhanced user interface.</p>
